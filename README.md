This is a clone of YouTube. This project was something to develop my skills as a web developer. The goal was to able to build a copy of YouTube and keep the quality as high as possible. Most of the channels, icons and videos you see on the dahboard of the site are my own ideas. And just a few are original items from YouTube. 

This project was built through the step-by-step guide of the full stack web development course I'm doing.
